Jefferies Group Inc. named valuation analyst William M. Smith to the newly created post of managing director and senior vice president , institutional research sales , and signed an exclusive agreement to market the services of his former firm .
The 45-year-old Mr. Smith , with his wife , Linda Zimbalist Smith , founded the Westport , Conn. , firm of Zimbalist Smith in 1982 .
The move by Jefferies marks an expansion of the brokerage concern 's emphasis on the institutional investment side of its business .
`` It represents our commitment to the institutional market , '' said Frank E. Baxter , Jefferies 's president and chief executive .
`` A number of brokerages have pulled back from institutional but we believe there is a lot of potential in that marketplace . ''
Mr. Smith , 45 years old , said his primary responsibility will be to market Jefferies 's investment products and services to portfolio managers , and high on the list of services will be the valuations offered by Zimbalist Smith .
Zimbalist Smith specializes in identifying undervalued companies that are likely targets for takeovers , buy-outs or restructurings , and assigning values to each of the possible outcomes .
In one recent study of stocks that were the subject of takeover rumors , the firm espouses selling rumored takeover stocks when they reach 75 % of their merger value .
Mrs. Smith will continue to run Zimbalist Smith , and Mr. Smith said he is now unaffiliated with the firm `` except by marriage . ''
The marketing agreement with Jefferies runs through the end of next year , and is renewable thereafter .
Zimbalist Smith previously had marketed its services through W&D Securities , which provided execution services to Jefferies .
Mr. Smith served as president of W&D until his appointment to the new post at Jefferies on Oct. 1 .
`` This is a recognition on Jefferies part that the institution can come to the company for both investment advice as well as Jefferies 's highly-regarded execution ability '' on securities trades , Mr. Smith said .
Jefferies specializes in block-trading in the so-called `` third market , '' away from the major exchanges .
Jefferies was founded by Boyd L. Jefferies , who pleaded guilty to two felony counts in April 1987 after being implicated in unlawful trading by stock speculator Ivan Boesky .
Mr. Jefferies , who resigned from the firm in 1987 , helped the government in its investigation of securities-law violations and was given a suspended sentence and fined $ 250,000 in July .
National Mine Service Co. said its hydraulic division was named exclusive rebuilder by J.H. Fletcher & Co. , of Huntington , W. Va. , for its mining equipment west of the Mississippi River .
National Mine did n't indicate how much revenue it expects to receive from Fletcher .
National Mine said its hydraulics division will service Fletcher customers as well .

Air Wis Services Inc. said September traffic at its Air Wisconsin unit dropped 3 % to 34.8 million revenue passenger miles from 35.9 million a year earlier .
A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile .
Air Wisconsin operates as United Express , a feeder commuter service affiliated with UAL Corp. 's United Airlines .
The unit 's load factor , or percentage of seats filled , dropped to 44 % from 48.4 % .
For the first nine months this year , Air Wisconsin 's traffic was up 1.6 % to 325.5 million revenue passenger miles from 320.5 million .
Year-to-date load factor slipped to 47.3 % from 49.6 % .
Resolution Funding Corp. said the auction of its securities to finance the savings-and-loan bailout will begin Oct. 25 .
Meanwhile , an important lawmaker is trying to thwart a plan by the new thrift-bailout agency , Resolution Trust Corp. , to raise other working capital .
Resolution Funding Corp. will issue $ 30 billion in bonds over the next two years , backed by zero-coupon Treasury securities financed by contributions from the S&L industry .
The amounts and maturity of the first Refcorp auction will n't be announced until Wednesday .
Refcorp said the bonds will n't be subject to redemption prior to maturity , unless it designates those terms for a particular series of bonds .
Refcorp also said the bonds may be stripped into their separate interest and principal components .
In addition , the Resolution Trust Corp. , the new agency that will close or merge sick thrifts , will also require working capital to carry the assets of failed S&Ls until they can be sold .
The most likely way to raise that capital , RTC officials say , would be for the agency to create a private thrift or bank under its supervision .
That institution would acquire assets from the sick thrifts under government control , and then issue a security to the public , backed by the assets .
Such a mechanism would keep the spending of those funds from adding to the federal budget deficit .
But the RTC plan violates the intent of Congress in its massive savings-and-loan bailout law , said Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y. -RRB- , an influential member of the House Banking Committee .
Yesterday , he sent Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady a letter vehemently objecting to such a plan , saying it shows `` a complete disregard for the integrity of the budget process . ''
Mr. Schumer said the notes issued by such an RTC thrift would require a higher interest rate that of regular Treausry debt .
Moreover , he said Congress intended to allow RTC to issue a certain amount of debt only to the acquirers of sick S&Ls -- not the public .
Officials of RTC said the agency probably will n't decide how to raise the capital for another week or so .
Baxter International Inc. and Waste Management Inc. are teaming up to sell waste consulting services to hospitals .

Assets of the nation 's 470 money market mutual funds increased $ 899.9 million in the week ended Wednesday to a record $ 349.89 billion .
`` Inflows of monies into individual accounts continued unabated last week even though yield spreads favoring money market funds over alternative investments available to individuals remained virtually unchanged , '' said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Investment Company Institute .
The Washington trade group tracks money funds and reports assets on a weekly basis to the Federal Reserve Board .
Funds continued to flow out of institutional-type funds , albeit at a slower pace than the previous week , when they fell a revised $ 594.5 million .
The 141 institutional funds decreased $ 21.3 million to $ 83.14 billion in the week ended Wednesday .
In the week ended Oct. 4 , the net decline in assets , which was revised to $ 378.2 million , was only the first in more than three months , the institute said .

The battlefield of politics is like the battlefield of war ; old tactics rarely win new battles .
If the results from California over the past two years are any indication , the victorious tacticians for the 1990 elections will be the Democrats .
Traditionally , urban voters received electoral information via the political machine .
The machine won votes by having precinct captains talk to each voter in a neighborhood about his problems and get city government to solve those problems .
Since the rise of suburbs and electronic media , however , it has become cheaper for candidates to contact voters without going through a machine .
But necessarily this has led to mass , not individual , appeals .
Now California Democrats are revolutionizing campaigns for legislative office in large districts .
They are using grass-roots volunteers and paid precinct captains to ask voters about partisan preferences , positions on important issues , and basic demographic information .
These findings then are used to run separate campaigns among groups of voters , tailored to push individuals ' hot-buttons .
Direct mail , telephone banks and precinct walkers are used to tell a voter that the Democratic candidate agrees with his views on the one or two issues most important to that voter .
Once a voter tells a volunteer that he supports the party hopeful , Democrats produce an absentee-ballot application for the voter and maintain contact until he returns the ballot .
The Democrats now can run powerful campaigns that , because they are targeted so selectively , go unnoticed -- and thus uncountered -- until after the voters have decided .
Since each voter hears exactly what he wants to hear , each has little reason not to vote Democratic .
These new tactics were displayed most recently in the special congressional election to succeed Majority Whip Tony Coelho -LRB- D. , Modesto -RRB- .
Democratic State Assemblyman Gary Condit won with 57 % of the vote .
An astounding 40 % of his votes came from absentee ballots -LRB- 10 % would normally be high -RRB- .
Democratic managers said they had delivered 24,000 absentee-ballot applications , and that 20,000 -- 80 % -- were returned .
With more than 100,000 Democrats registered to vote in this district , it 's clear that the managers mailed the ballots only to pre-selected Democrats .
Former Gov. Jerry Brown , chairman of the state Democratic Party , boasted after the Condit victory , `` When the Republican mud began to roll through the streets of Modesto it was too late because one-third of the Democrats had already voted . ''
Other examples of this system at work :
-- 1988 -- Michael Dukakis almost won California , losing only 51 % to 48 % .
The Almanac of American Politics says that `` the Democrats ' strategy -LCB- was -RCB- to reinvent the precinct organization. . . .
The Democrats ' organizational efforts were probably worth a couple of points. . . . ''
Tactics worth `` a couple of points '' in a presidential race will be worth more in less visible legislative races .
Not surprisingly , two GOP Assembly incumbents were defeated for re-election in California that November , the first Republican Assembly incumbents defeated in the state since 1980 .
-- 1989 -- `` Pro-choice '' Republican Tricia Hunter of the San Diego area defeated a `` pro-life '' Republican by 100 votes in a special Assembly primary , largely because of a phone and computer campaign run courtesy of Democratic Speaker Willie Brown 's political operatives .
The operatives identified pro-choice Democrats and emphasized the abortion issue among them . -LRB- Special-election procedures allow cross-party voting. -RRB- In a district where 33 % of the voters are registered Democrats , the only Democratic candidate on the ballot received 6.6 % ; the remainder voted for Ms. Hunter .
California has long led the nation in political marketing , so these results are of national significance .
Indeed , the techniques already appear to be spreading .
In another special election last month , for Jim Wright 's congressional seat in Texas , the GOP candidate `` won on Election Day , '' as they say , but lost the race when now-Rep .
Preston Geren carved out a 3,000-vote margin in the absentee ballots , which constituted 20 % of the total cast .
Why have Republicans , traditionally the leaders in election technology , been caught flat-footed ?
They 're the victims of complacency born of past success , and they 've tended to farm out work to consultants instead of centralizing campaign commands as these tactics require .
Meantime , Democrats , seeing defeats occur when marginal constituencies switched parties , had more of an incentive to plot a way to check that slippage .
Now the GOP will be lucky to get a rudimentary counter-apparatus in gear by next year 's off-year balloting .
This new system effectively recreates the political machine for legislative races in districts sufficiently large that standard door-to-door contact or an existing personal following are n't sufficient to secure victory for a candidate .
A computer makes communication cost-efficient by creating tiny clusters of people who share preferences , each cluster receiving the same campaign .
Sound far-fetched ?
Jerry Brown does n't think so .
He crowed after the Condit win : `` The message ?
The machine is the message .
We are building the machine .
And when the party is powerful enough , we can pick candidates and hold them accountable . ''
Individual candidates cannot afford the machinery needed to create this voting weapon .
Candidates in large legislative districts will quickly learn what their grandfathers knew in the 1930s -- to get elected , candidates will have to obey the party bosses .
Gary Hart , meet Mayor Daley .
Boss Tweed , meet Boss Brown .

Mr. Olsen , a third-year law student at the University of Chicago , was a California GOP legislative candidate in 1986 .
A House subcommittee approved a measure that would require telephone companies to provide special devices that enable deaf people to use the telephone .
The House telecommunications and finance subcommittee voted unanimously for the requirement , as part of a broader measure that would ban discrimination against the handicapped in employment , public accommodations , transportation , and communications .
The Commerce Committee panel was the first on the House side to vote on any part of the bill .
Three other House committees , including the Labor , Judiciary and Public Works panels , are also considering provisions of the bill , which has strong Bush administration support .
The Senate approved its version last month .
The telephone provision , similar to one contained in the Senate measure , would give phone companies three years to provide relay systems permitting linkups between deaf persons and telephone voice conversations .
Simple computers would allow deaf callers to use a keyboard to send messages to an operator , who would then relay them by spoken or similar teletype message to another person .
The operator also could relay telephone voice messages by teletype to a deaf person .
The bill would allow telephone companies to recover costs of the service through general rate making , but would prohibit monthly surcharges for all phone users in interstate service .
Deaf users could n't be forced to bear the full cost .
The service is estimated to add three cents a month to residential phones rates .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. generally supports the measure ; it provides such service in Alabama , California and New York , and has a similar plan for Illinois .
Precious metals futures prices rose on a report , later denied , that certain Japanese insurance companies were being allowed to buy more precious metals than they previously could .
Gold for December delivery advanced $ 1.30 an ounce to $ 367.40 , December silver was up one cent an ounce to $ 5.1530 , and January platinum gained $ 5.20 an ounce to $ 491.50 .
Demand for contracts followed a news service report from Tokyo that gold , platinum and silver futures prices surged after the Japanese News Agency said Japanese non-life insurers were buying precious metals .
The news agency said the buying was a result of a government ruling allowing the companies to increase their precious metals holdings .
Subsequently , Knight-Ridder Inc. , which had relayed the Japanese News Agency report , said Tokyo officials rejected that report as `` unjustified . ''
Traders in Tokyo said the Japanese News Agency story led some to believe a rule allowing the insurers to put 3 % of their investment portfolios into precious metals represented an increase , Knight-Ridder said .
In fact , the 3 % maximum has been in effect for more than a year , Knight-Ridder said .
Knight-Ridder quoted traders as saying Japanese officials might have simply urged the insurers to bring their precious metals holdings up to the 3 % limit to help combat the dollar 's current rise .
Knight-Ridder said the officials indicated that insurers ' precious metals holdings are below the maximum allowed .
They did n't disclose specific levels .
The buying sparked by the original news report had the strongest effect on platinum because of a Japanese affinity for that metal , and it had a smaller effect on gold , said William O' Neill , vice president , research , for Elders Futures Inc. in New York .
Silver edged up slightly in sympathy with the other two metals , he said .
`` It is n't likely these companies are going to rush out to buy platinum and gold simply because the government is encouraging them to do so , '' Mr. O' Neill said .
`` They still have a sour taste in their mouths from the last time they bought precious metals in substantial quantities and the market was unable to hold advances .
As a result , they 're holding platinum and gold in their portfolios that are showing losses . ''
Mr. O' Neill said buying of precious metals by these insurers is `` only a minor factor in the long-term scheme of things . ''
In other commodity markets yesterday :
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices closed higher , continuing the week 's strong showing on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery closed 22 cents higher at $ 20.47 a barrel .
Heating oil finished the session higher , but November contracts for unleaded gasoline fell 0.16 of a cent to 55.57 cents a gallon .
Analysts and traders cited a large increase in U.S. gasoline supplies , as measured weekly by the American Petroleum Institute .
Gasoline for later delivery rose in price .
Market participants seemed to ignore the institute 's statistics that showed somewhat higher crude oil inventories and held onto their optimism of the past several sessions , moving prices higher in light trading .
COPPER : Futures prices rose on reports that a production disruption at a major U.S. refinery would delay shipments .
The December contract advanced 1.75 cents a pound to $ 1.3035 .
The production problem at the Magma Copper Co. plant in San Manuel , Ariz. , was described by a company spokesman as minor and temporary .
The spokesman said a failure in the refinery 's electrolytic system a week ago caused material to accumulate on a group of cathodes , or sheets of copper , so that they did n't meet certain specifications .
The problem has been discovered and corrected , he said , and it will take about a week for the system to return to normal .
The spokesman said the problem affected only one batch of cathodes with special specifications .
`` The copper is perfectly fine otherwise and can be sold elsewhere , '' he said .
In any case , he said , there is nothing wrong with the plant , which is in full production .
`` We called a force majeure for an indefinite time to protect ourselves in this specific case until we can resume normal shipments , '' he said .
A declaration of force majeure refers to an inability to meet a contractual agreement because of forces beyond the shipper 's control .
ORANGE JUICE : Futures prices were slightly higher in thin trading ahead of a government crop report .
The November contract rose 0.75 of a cent a pound to $ 1.3705 .
After the close of trading , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , in its first estimate of the Florida orange crop for the season beginning Dec. 1 , said production will amount to 130 million boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes in the current season .
A box is 90 pounds .
The projection was near the low end of estimates , which ranged between 125 million and 150 million boxes , said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , New York .
Although prices are likely to rise today on the basis of the low estimate , she said , the advance `` should be short-lived '' because of expectations that Brazilian shipments of concentrate will fill a supply gap estimated at around 20 million gallons .
Brazilian shipments had been delayed but are expected to begin arriving in large volumes soon , according to Ms. Ganes .
She said this flow of juice into the U.S. could weigh on prices because it will be coming just before the start of the Florida harvest .
Ms. Ganes also said that now that the Florida estimate is out of the way , Brazilian processors are likely to cut prices to stimulate consumption of their product , which is expected to be in plentiful supply .
The inspector general 's office of the Health and Human Services Department said it is conducting a criminal investigation of Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. for possible `` false information '' concerning applications to manufacture at least two generic drugs and other matters .
The investigation was confirmed by Judy Holtz , a spokeswoman at the inspector general 's office .
She said the case has been discussed with the U.S. attorney 's office in Baltimore , which has been leading a criminal probe of the generic drug industry that has already resulted in several convictions .
But so far , she said , the U.S. attorney has n't decided to act on the case , and the case has n't been presented to a grand jury .
On news of the investigation on the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report news wire , Bolar shares fell $ 1.875 to $ 17 in American Stock Exchange composite trading on volume of 1.2 million shares .
Specifically , Ms. Holtz said the criminal investigation involves possible false information concerning Bolar 's drug applications for its version of Dyazide , a blood pressure medicine , and its version of Macrodantin , a urinary tract antibiotic .
Together , those two drugs represent an estimated 50 % of Bolar 's annual sales .
Bolar also is under investigation about circumstances surrounding the company 's use of a brand name anti-psychotic drug as Bolar 's product in outside laboratory testing in 1982 .
However , FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said he believed the criminal statute of limitation had already expired and that Bolar could n't be charged in connection with that drug testing .
The company has said that was an inadvertent mix-up .
On Monday , Bolar President Robert Shulman said the company had n't been informed that it was the target of a criminal probe .
Ms. Holtz said Mr. Shulman was interviewed Tuesday by an investigator from the inspector general 's office and a representative of the Food and Drug Administration .
Yesterday Mr. Shulman was out of the country on business and could n't be reached .
Patricia Shukri , vice president at Bolar , said an outside lawyer for the company learned of the probe yesterday but did n't get any details .
Gary Jordan , an assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore in charge of the generic drug probe , declined to comment about Bolar .
He said his office has a policy of not confirming or denying criminal investigations .
Earlier this week Bolar voluntarily recalled its 100mg version of the urinary tract antibiotic , then it expanded the recall to the 50mg capsules of the same drug .
Combined , those two versions of Macrodantin represent about 10 % of Bolar 's total annual sales .
Macrodantin is made by Norwich Eaton , a unit of Procter & Gamble Co. of Cincinnati .
Bolar had said the FDA presented evidence suggesting that Bolar passed off Macrodantin as its own to obtain government clearance to market a generic version .
Bolar denied the accusation and said an outside firm would audit its drug applications to clear the matter .
As previously reported , the FDA issued a statement in August saying it did n't have any evidence of fraud in Bolar 's application for its version of Dyazide , which is made by SmithKline Beecham PLC .
Afterwards , however , FDA Commissioner Frank Young said Bolar had n't been exonerated of suspicions that it substituted the brand name product as its own to gain governmental approval to market a generic version of Dyazide .
Mr. Nesbit , the FDA spokesman , said the agency continues to investigate .
Bolar 's version of Dyazide remains the sole generic on the market , but the FDA has downgraded the product so that it 's no longer considered the therapeutic equivalent of the SmithKline product .
-LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB-
IN 1971 , THE U.S. HAD ITS FIRST TRADE DEFICIT since 1888 .
It began a headache that will n't go away .
Surging imports of Japanese cars and TV sets , European goods , Middle Eastern oil and other-nation raw materials topped U.S. exports by $ 2.05 billion .
Just the prior year the U.S. had a trade surplus of $ 2.7 billion .
The out-of-kilter trade had caused President Nixon on Aug. 15 to slap -- briefly -- a 10 % surcharge on goods accounting for about half the $ 45 billion annual imports then . -LRB- He also allowed the dollar to float freely , unpegged to gold , against foreign currencies .
Overvalued dollars , high U.S. oil imports and Japanese competition were the main culprits for U.S. trade imbalances . -RRB-
`` Made in the U.S.A. '' lost its luster , and protectionist pressure rose .
Treasury Secretary John Connally as early as the prior May -- the first time in more than 20 years that U.S. trade was in the red two months in a row -- said the U.S. should `` get tough '' with its trading partners .
Britain , Canada and other nations beefed about the 10 % surcharge , claiming it was illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
Nixon killed it on Dec. 20 , 1971 , as he devalued the dollar by raising the official gold price 8.57 % .
Trade deficits have been recorded for the past 13 years in a row .
The figure will be more than $ 100 billion this year , analysts say , compared with $ 118 billion in 1988 and the record $ 152 billion in 1987 .
Rightly or wrongly , but not necessarily rationally , currency traders and others use the monthly figures as an excuse to buy or sell if the deficit is more or less than predictions , notes a Commerce Department official .
Guaranteed minimum 6 % .
Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .

When Woody Allen ponders the universe it 's funny .
Yet his special comic talent does n't seem to satisfy him -- and maybe it could n't after all the movies he 's made .
In recent years he 's felt compelled to be more `` serious , '' to take the nagging questions that have given his comedy its edge and to ask them straight .
He 's been using this method , which he first experimented with years ago in `` Interiors , '' in what he calls his `` ensemble pieces . ''
These pictures -- notably `` Hannah and Her Sisters , '' `` September , '' `` Another Woman '' -- have been extremely polished works , all very beautiful and all unsatisfying in varying degrees .
In these problematic films , Mr. Allen has assigned other people the job of giving serious articulation to the angst that elsewhere so hilariously perfuses his Woody Allen screen personality .
These glum Allen surrogates usually sound hopelessly mannered , like people translating a foreign language with words that are technically correct but that miss the spirit of the original .
That 's why Mr. Allen 's funny short film , `` Oedipus Wrecks '' -- his one-third of this spring 's `` New York Stories '' omnibus -- seemed like a reward to those who dutifully sat through `` September '' and `` Another Woman . ''
Comedy probably does n't feel like serious work to him anymore , but it 's a rare treat for the rest of us , who recently have been putting up with an eversteadier diet of his ethereal ensembles .
And since Mr. Allen 's new `` Crimes and Misdemeanors '' came officially tagged with the dread E word , I was n't whistling on my way to the screening room .
But either his determination to succeed in this genre is wearing me down , or this picture really is more enjoyable than its predecessors .
Though he does n't have much new to say about the lumpen-intellectual New York world on whose fringes he operates , this time around he 's put a neat , cynical twist on his characters ' labored musings about love and death and morality .
As usual , he 's divvied up the concerns that used to belong to him , back when he was his main and best character , among a number of different characters .
Like Mr. Allen , all of them are maneuvering their way through middle age , though none of them have much of a sense of humor about the passage .
He certainly knows these people .
And he 's perfectly captured their look and manner with Sven Nykvist 's elegant cinematography .
At the center of their overlapping stories is Judah Rosenthal -LRB- Martin Landau -RRB- , a familiar type -- a successful physician who 's also a philanthropist , also knowledgeable about art and music , also possessor of a lovely wife and daughter .
Judah 's perfection , his smug acceptance of his fine lot in life , would be almost unbearable if he did n't have a big headache on his hands .
She 's Dolores -LRB- Anjelica Huston -RRB- , his neurotic airline-hostess mistress who 's tired of being Madame X .
Her power over Judah is enormous because only she can expose his hypocrisy .
While Judah figures out how to dispose of this problem , many other relationships are built , while others fall apart .
By far the most compelling figures are Cliff , the documentary film maker played by Mr. Allen , and his fancy TV producer brother-in-law Lester , played by Alan Alda .
Mr. Allen supplies the comic relief and Mr. Alda provides the surprise .
He 's not the least bit ingratiating here , in a nicely nasty portrait of the vain , slick exercise of power , Hollywood style .
The cast includes many Allen reliables , including Mia Farrow and Sam Waterston , and they are reliable .
There are a few cameo appearances by Allen-film newcomers , too , notably by the blonde actress Darryl Hannah and the brunette writer Nora Ephron .
The film also provides the bluntest blunt expression of Mr. Allen 's sour vision of life since `` Stardust Memories , '' a cynicism that usually is disguised by his nostalgia and his romanticizing angle of vision on architecture , music and women .

I never managed to like `` Breaking In '' quite as much as I wanted to like it .
One wants to feel warmly toward a film that has a faded stud like Burt Reynolds playing the part of a codger , an old thief , with the greatest dexterity and charm .
He 's just wonderful .
The rest of the film is n't bad , just pokey about getting to a payoff that does n't really exist .
Still , there is a sweetness to this tale of an experienced burglar who tries to teach a new thief old tricks .
Mr. Reynolds , jowly and limping , has a marvelous sense of the way a certain kind of precise older man goes about his business , whether he 's an engineer or an editor or a thief .
He loves what he does because he does it well , and he does n't expend much energy rhapsodizing about it or even spending the money he steals .
He 's a prudent man , saves what he needs and spends the rest on his few luxuries -- including his steady `` girlfriend , '' the hooker he 's rented regularly for a year .
He stumbles across his protege , when they bump into each other trying to rob the same house .
The kid is played by Casey Siemaszko , the pudding-faced young actor who 's appeared in `` Stand By Me , '' `` Back to the Future '' and `` Gardens of Stone . ''
Though the chemistry between them seems right , not much happens .
That 's the style of Scottish director Bill Forsyth -LRB- `` Local Hero , '' `` Gregory 's Girl , '' `` Housekeeping '' -RRB- , and usually the whimsical incidentals along the way make the trip a treat , even if you do n't get anywhere .
But the director worked here with a script by John Sayles , whose considerable talents do n't include whimsy .
It 's hard to tell who was leading whom , but in any case the dance does n't go smoothly and seems to take a very long time .

Canadian housing starts rose 9.6 % in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 216,000 from an August rate of 197,000 , Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. , a federal agency , said .
The agency attributed the September increase mainly to a sharp rise in construction of rental and condominium dwellings in the Vancouver and Montreal areas .
Sir Colin Chandler , 50 years old , was named managing director for this British defense and automobiles group .

Societe Generale de Belgique SA -LRB- SGB -RRB- , Belgium 's largest holding company , increased its stake in its banking affiliate , Generale de Banque , to nearly 20 % , a spokesman for SGB said .
That is up from a holding of 13 % at year end 1988 .
The spokesman confirmed a report in the Belgian financial daily De Tijd that the holding company recently had bought a 5 % block of Generale de Banque shares sold by Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV -LRB- Amro -RRB- .
The spokesman said SGB 's holding in Generale de Banque now amounts to 19.44 % .
Amro and Generale de Banque announced they would reduce their 10 % cross-shareholdings by half after merger talks between the two broke down in September .
The SGB spokesman did n't say at what price the Generale de Belgique shares were bought .
Dalgety PLC , a British food and agricultural products company , said it has exited food commodities trading with the sale of its Gill & Duffus unit for # 87.4 million -LRB- $ 135.9 million -RRB- .
Gill & Duffus , which Dalgety acquired in 1985 , was sold off in four parts to a combination of management and outside investors .
Dalgety did n't disclose individual proceeds of the sale .
Maurice Warren , Dalgety 's managing director , said the company sold its Gill & Duffus trading units to focus on downstream operations in food manufacturing and agribusiness .
He added that the move was largely a response to unpredictable earnings from the highly volatile and cyclical commodity markets , which had eroded returns from Gill & Duffus during the five years that Dalgety controlled the international trading and brokerage company .
Pier 1 Imports Inc. , a specialty retailer , said its September sales rose 26 % to $ 47.1 million from $ 37.5 million .
The company said sales rose 7 % at stores open for more than a year .
I appreciated Thomas W. Hazlett 's review of my book , `` The Farm Fiasco '' -LRB- `` Bushels of Dough , '' Leisure & Arts , Sept. 21 -RRB- .
However , it had numerous errors .
Mr. Hazlett states that farmers `` are ever close to the margin . ''
This is very misleading : Agriculture Department studies show that the average full-time farmer has a net worth of more than $ 1 million -LRB- more than 12 times higher than that of the average American family -RRB- .
The average full-time farmer enjoyed a farm income of $ 136,255 in 1987 .
Full-time farmers have had far higher incomes than average Americans throughout the 1980s .
The comparative wealth of farmers was a major point of my book ; I 'm surprised Mr. Hazlett missed it .
Mr. Hazlett characterizes farm landowners as `` typically . . . rich Republican country clubbers who regularly denounce welfare handouts over gin-and-tonics . ''
This may be true around Davis , Calif. , where Mr. Hazlett resides , but that is definitely not the case in Kansas , Iowa , South Dakota , etc. Midwest farmers may be wealthy , but they are not `` country club '' types -- and they prefer beer and whiskey over gin-and-tonics .
Mr. Hazlett 's caricature is a libel on most farmers .
Mr. Hazlett implies -LRB- in his statements that farmers `` are ever close to the margin '' while landowners are rich country clubbers -RRB- that there is little overlap between farmers and farm landowners .
In reality , a substantial majority of farmers own the land they plant .
Thus , farmers have reaped most of the benefits of the federally induced rise in farmland values .
Mr. Hazlett contrasts farm programs under Presidents Carter and Reagan : `` ag subsidies had fallen to just $ 4 billion annually under Carter , but have totaled $ 260 billion in the '80s . ''
But the $ 4 billion figure under Mr. Carter counts only government outlays , while the $ 260 billion figure counts both government outlays and higher food costs to consumers caused by federal policies .
Adding consumer costs to the Carter figure would produce a total cost of about $ 12 billion to $ 15 billion , and would weaken Mr. Hazlett 's efforts to blame Republicans for soaring farm spending .
He observes , `` The specific aim of recent Republican reforms is to shift the subsidies off-budget , imposing supply controls in USDA-sponsored cartels to raise commodity prices without direct subsidies .
Consider the 1983-84 PIK program. . . . ''
But under the PIK program , government did not impose involuntary controls on farmers and there was no cartel effort involved .
Many farmers who stayed out of the PIK program reaped huge profits .
The term `` supply controls '' usually refers to mandatory controls imposed by government on farmers .
Actually , most Republicans in Congress have fought tooth and nail to avoid supply controls , while the Democrats -LRB- Gephardt , Harkin , etc. -RRB- have led the push to impose mandatory controls .
The House -LRB- though not the Senate -RRB- voted in favor of mandatory controls in 1986 : Probably six times as many Democrats as Republicans favored mandatory controls .
Both the Reagan administration and the Bush administration have been adamant in their opposition to mandatory controls .

Lyphomed Inc. plans to distribute for free to indigent patients an aerosol drug that can prevent a type of pneumonia that kills as many as 80 % of all AIDS patients .
The drug manufacturer has been considering the idea of free distribution for the last couple of months , but decided to give aerosol pentamidine at no charge only to patients who can n't afford it , said John N. Kapoor , chairman of the Rosemont , Ill. , company .
Dispersals should begin within a week , Mr. Kapoor said .
It was n't clear , however , how the drug will be distributed or how many patients it would effect .
The target group will include patients whose insurance policies do n't cover the cost of the drug , Mr. Kapoor said .
The move follows months of criticism by AIDS activists who accused the company of profiteering .
Typically , aerosol pentamidine costs about $ 100 for a 300 milligram dose taken once a month .
The drug , along with Burroughs Wellcome Co. 's AZT , is credited with helping prolong the lives of people with AIDS .
Last summer , the Food and Drug Administration granted approval for aerosol pentamidine , which staves off both first attacks and recurrences of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , a deadly AIDS-related form of the illness .
Lyphomed currently is the sole supplier of the drug .
As a so-called orphan drug , or one aimed at a small market , aerosol pentamidine is protected by a seven-year exclusive patent .
Lyphomed 's closest rival is a British company , Fisons PLC , which has submitted its own research to the FDA , but has n't yet gotten approval .
Candidates for the drug are AIDS patients whose count on T-helper lymphocytes , cells vital to the immune system , falls below 200 per cubic millimeter of blood .
Such a level places them in the highest danger of developing pneumonia .
Estimates vary widely as to how many AIDS patients are candidates for the drug .
But the aerosal is also used by people who have contracted the virus that causes AIDS , but who have n't developed the disease .
Separately , Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. said that Lyphomed shareholders had tendered 99.2 % of the company 's outstanding shares under its $ 31.87-a-share buy-out proposal .
The offer values the total company at $ 956.7 million .
Fujisawa said it received 18.4 million shares under the offer , which expired Tuesday .

Francaise des Petroles -LRB- CFP -RRB- said its consolidated net profit surged to 1.709 billion French francs -LRB- $ 267 million -RRB- in the first half of 1989 from 237 million francs -LRB- $ 37 million -RRB- a year earlier and 1.479 billion francs -LRB- $ 231 million -RRB- for all of 1988 .
The state-controlled French oil group said that its first-half profit included a contribution of 1.47 billion francs from an upward adjustment of the value of its oil inventories following a rise in energy prices .
This was in contrast with the comparable year-earlier period , when downward pressure on oil prices lopped 390 million francs from the value of the group 's stocks .
Total 's consolidated revenue climbed 28 % in the first half to 51.131 billion francs from 40.027 billion a year earlier .
The group explained that the advance was fueled by a gain in volume terms that was further boosted by the firm tone of oil prices and the dollar 's advance .

Jeffrey A. Evershed , 40 years old , was named to the new post of president and chief executive officer for the four mortgage company subsidiaries of this financial services company .
He had been president of Franklin Mortgage Capital Corp. , McLean , Va. , a subsidiary of Franklin Savings Association , Ottawa , Kan .
Schweizerische Aluminium AG , a Swiss chemical and aluminum group better known as Alusuisse , said its French subsidiary , Alusuisse France S.A. , has bought a 40 % stake in the French packaging manufacturer Raymond Morin S.A. .
The value of the transaction was n't disclosed , but the Zurich-based parent of the French unit said , `` For the Alusuisse group , this participation is a further step in the strategic development of its packaging business . ''
Raymond Morin , the leading supplier in France of flexible packaging to the food industry , had a turnover in 1988 of 350 million French francs -LRB- $ 54.6 million -RRB- , according to a statement released by Alusuisse .
Raymond Morin , which employs 400 people at its plant in Sarrebourg , France , holds a major share of the French market for packaging of cheese , dairy products , coffee and soups , the statement said .
About 30 % of its output is exported to Europe and North America .
Ann McLaughlin , former secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor , was elected a director of this insurance , financial-services and investment company .

France 's seasonally adjusted current account swung to a second-quarter deficit of 8.11 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.27 billion -RRB- from a revised first-quarter surplus of 9.93 billion francs , according to the Economics Ministry .
The first-quarter surplus was reported initially at a provisional 6.52 billion francs .
John LeBoutillier 's arguments to `` Normalize Ties With Vietnam Now '' -LRB- editorial page , Sept. 15 -RRB- should awaken Americans to the startling divergence between foreign policy as presented to the public and foreign policy in actual practice .
He states this point dramatically when he refers to the State Department 's public pronouncements against the Khmer Rouge on the same day it agreed with China to let the Khmer Rouge take part in a new Cambodian government .
Even more glaring has been the repeated declaration since 1980 about the recovery of POWs in Vietnam being of the highest national priority while actually placing much higher priority on the conflicting policy of supporting military action against the Vietnamese in Cambodia .
None of the evidence on POWs has been made public -- apparently because the public would then reverse these priorities -- and the organization of POW families has been co-opted for the sake of maintaining these priorities .
The Vietnamese desperately want the ties that will lead to favorable aid and trade activities ; POWs would be the only bargaining chip they have .
If we unite with the Vietnamese in their opposition to the Khmer Rouge , while showing some genuine seriousness about negotiating the POW issue , we may find that both these problems will be solved simultaneously .

The Agriculture Department has suspended a grain-exporting company believed to be controlled by Marc Rich , a fugitive commodity trader , from the government 's export-subsidy program .
Rep. Dan Glickman has pressed the department to stop subsidizing the grain sales of Richco Grain Ltd. , after learning in April that the obscure company received $ 65 million in subsidies in the past four years .
A subsequent tally by the department showed Richco was one of the leading recipients of the subsidies , collecting more than $ 95 million since July 1986 .
At the urging of the Kansas Democrat , the department 's inspector general investigated Richco 's ties to Mr. Rich and his business partner , Pincus Green , who both fled to Switzerland in 1983 shortly before they were indicted on tax evasion , racketeering and other charges stemming from an alleged international oil-trading scheme to avoid paying millions in U.S. taxes .
Department officials determined the multimillionaire fugitives own more than half of Richco 's stock , with Mr. Rich holding 3,000 shares and Mr. Green holding about 1,100 of 8,000 shares outstanding , according to Mr. Glickman .
Although neither serves as a Richco director or officer , the officials concluded that Messrs .
Rich and Green still control the company , Mr. Glickman said .
In confirming the first suspension in the history of the so-called Export Enhancement Program , a department official said : `` There is some concern that Marc Rich and Pincus Green own enough stock between them that they could potentially have tremendous influence with Richco . ''
Rep. Glickman , chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feed grains , expressed outrage over the case , saying the Richco subsidies undermined the credibility of an export program that is vital to U.S. farmers .
`` Not only is Marc Rich the largest tax evader in the history of the U.S. , but he 's a fugitive from justice , '' Rep. Glickman said in an interview .
`` How could the department keep doing business with him ? ''
Robert Thomajan , an attorney for Richco , said the company will file an administrative appeal of the Sept. 29 suspension , which was recommended by Rolland Anderson , administrator of the department 's Foreign Agricultural Service .
Mr. Thomajan would n't comment on whether Richco was indeed controlled by Messrs .
Rich and Green .
Richco shares offices with Clarendon Ltd. , a Rich-affiliated entity in Stamford , Conn. , and has the same telephone number as Clarendon .
Ben Berte , a Richco commodity trader in Stamford , declined to comment .
Unlike Clarendon , Richco was never charged with any wrongdoing .
In a 1984 civil settlement , Clarendon and Marc Rich & Co. , the giant commodity-trading concern based in Zug , Switzerland , pleaded guilty to fraud and tax-evasion charges and paid $ 150 million to the U.S. government as well as contempt-of-court fines totaling $ 21 million .
In addition , the companies gave up as much as $ 40 million in tax deductions .
But the Internal Revenue Service is still offering a huge reward for information leading to Mr. Rich 's arrest .
Until recently , Richco had been competing with such big multinationals as Cargill Inc. , Continental Grain Co. and Louis Dreyfus Corp. for export subsidies .
Under the Export Enhancement Program , the companies sell U.S. grain to customers overseas at prices below U.S. market prices .
To make up the difference , the companies then collect `` bonuses , '' or subsidies , in the form of surplus grain from the Agriculture Department .
The program 's primary purpose is to counter heavily subsidized exports from the European Community .
Richco has collected bonuses on 73 overseas sales since mid-1986 , according to the department 's tally .
Most of the transactions were barley sales to Saudi Arabia and Romania and wheat sales to the Soviet Union and China .
`` It 's difficult to know what their profit is , '' said Mr. Glickman .
Typically , grain exporters make 2 % profit on such sales .
Under the 1984 settlement , Mr. Rich 's U.S. affiliates were allowed to deal with the U.S. government so long as they were n't acting as `` alter egos '' of Mr. Rich .
Although Agriculture Department officials thought they could n't prove Richco was such an alter ego , according to Mr. Glickman , they still concluded that they had legal grounds for suspending Richco because the company is under Mr. Rich 's control .
In investigating Richco 's capitalization , added Gregory Frazier , a Glickman aide , `` they traced the line of ownership back through Marc Rich & Co. to Rich himself . ''
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it began public offerings of $ 750 million of debentures and notes as part of a refinancing .
The cable programmer said the offerings include $ 550 million of 12 % senior subordinated debentures due 2001 , and $ 200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004 .
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is acting as the sole underwriter for the debentures , and Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Merrill Lynch Capital Markets unit is acting as the sole underwriter for the notes .
Turner said it intends to use the proceeds from the offerings , together with anticipated borrowings from a group of banks , to fund its refinancing of about $ 1.4 billion of debt .
Daimler-Benz AG said it expects to reach an agreement by Oct. 20 with the states of Hamburg and Bremen on the terms for its acquisition of a majority stake in Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. .
A spokesman for the West German automobile and technology company said the company expects all the open questions involving the north German states that own stakes in MBB will be answered by that point .
MBB owners will be meeting in Munich on Oct. 20 .
Daimler said a vote on the MBB acquisition will be on the agenda for that meeting .
Daimler-Benz has won approval from the Economics Ministry to acquire 50.01 % of MBB for about 1.7 billion marks -LRB- $ 892 million -RRB- , but has met resistance from Hamburg and Bremen , two northern German city states , which fear a loss of jobs as a result of the takeover .
The opposition from Hamburg and Bremen has threatened to delay the takeover of MBB , which Daimler 's Chairman Edzard Reuter said he wants to complete before year end .
Currently , Hamburg owns 18.2 % of MBB and Bremen holds 10 % .
B.F. Goodrich Co. said it completed the purchase of Culligan International Co. 's Arrowhead Industrial Water unit , based in Lincolnshire , Ill. .

The number of Hispanics in the U.S. grew in the 1980s more than five times as fast as the rest of the population , the government reported .
The Census Bureau said that the nation 's Hispanic population numbered 20.1 million as of March 1989 , 38.9 % greater than in 1980 .
The rest of the population grew 7.5 % in the same years .
The bulk of the Hispanics in the U.S.-about six in every 10 -- are of Mexican origin .
About one in 10 is from Puerto Rican roots .
Nearly all the rest come from other Central or South American countries , although the Census Bureau also counts as Hispanics persons from Spain and those who describe themselves as Spanish or Latino .
Two-thirds of this country 's Hispanics live in three states , the bureau added .
California has 34 % and Texas has 21 % , most of them Mexican .
New York has 10 % , most of them Puerto Rican .
Hispanics now account for about 8.2 % of the 243.7 million people living in the U.S. .
United Telecommunications Inc. and its US Sprint Communications Co. unit announced a long-awaited consolidation to curb costs , improve efficiency and react more swiftly to the market .
The realignment , which essentially splits the business into its long-distance operations and its local telecommunications operations , comes nine months after United Telecom brought controlling interest in Sprint from GTE Corp. United now owns 80.1 % of Sprint and has options to acquire the rest .
William T. Esrey , United Telecom president and chief executive officer , said the realignment `` allows us to operate as one company overall . ''
He said some further changes will be made over the next few months to encourage `` efficiencies and rapid decision-making . ''
Analysts speculated that United Telecom not only is concerned about curbing costs but also wants to get its top management in place in anticipation of the retirement next spring of Chairman Paul H. Henson , who along with Mr. Esrey has reshaped United Telecom from a local telephone concern to a rapidly expanding long-distance carrier .
Mr. Esrey is expected to be named to the added post of chairman once Mr. Henson retires .
Under changes announced yesterday , Mr. Esrey , 49 years old , takes on the extra job of chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint , the nation 's third-largest long-distance telephone company .
Long-distance operations would be led by Ronald T. LeMay , 43 , who becomes president of United Telecom 's long-distance division and president and chief operating officer of Sprint .
He had been executive vice president for corporate affairs .
The local telephone operations would fall under Curtis G. Fields , 56 , executive vice president ; he was named president of the local telecommunications division .
All financial operations will report to Arthur B. Krause , 48 , United Telecom 's chief financial officer .
In addition , the company is merging all data systems and information management operations , reporting to Richard H. Brown , who was named executive vice president and chief information and planning officer .
Mr. Brown , who had been senior vice president , also has responsibility for strategic planning , business development and technology planning .
Meanwhile , Telenet , Sprint 's successful data unit , is taking on a new mission to expand international voice and data operations .
Telenet 's public data network functions as well as its marketing operations and most of its sales force are being blended with Sprint 's .
Even its electronic mail operations are being renamed Sprint Mail .
Telenet president Paolo L. Guidi , 47 , will head a new US Sprint International Systems and Services Group , to provide international voice and data services , electronic messaging systems as well as data and corporate networks overseas and in the U.S. Mr. Esrey said he anticipates a big push to develop a `` global data network . ''
Mr. Esrey said the company hopes the changes improve the Sprint sales force 's ability to sell data as well as voice services and strengthen the company 's postition overseas .
`` With an all digital , all fiber-optic network , we ought to be ahead in selling data services , '' he said , adding that Telenet 's expertise has been `` focused more narrowly than it should be . ''
As for controlling costs , Mr. Esrey said the realignment was `` a step in that direction .
I think we can do a better job than we have done . ''
Nevertheless , Mr. Esrey said the consolidation is n't expected to result in layoffs because of the company 's swift growth .
On Tuesday , United Telecom stock plunged $ 3.375 a share after its third-quarter earnings report indicated the company had n't curbed costs as much as analysts had anticipated .
Yesterday , the stock closed at $ 82.75 , down 50 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The reorganization also included United 's top legal post .
John F. Dodd , 58 , executive vice president and general counsel , is taking early retirement at the end of the year to resume private practice .
He will be succeeded by Richard Devlin , 39 , who will be responsible for the consolidated legal and external affairs operations .
